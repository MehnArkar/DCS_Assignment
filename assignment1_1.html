    <h3>My Trip To California</h3>
    <p>
        It was a long, quick trip. We loaded our vehicle and headed to Northern California for the 4th of July weekend for a family reunion. We then made haste to Magic Mountain. By the time we returned home, we had traveled some 1,300 miles in three and one half days.

    <h3>My Trip To The Rockies</h3>
    <p>
        After a year's preparation, it was time to go backpacking with the Boy Scouts. We flew to Colorado Springs, toured the Air Force Academy, Pike's Peak, Garden Of The Gods, and the Olympic training center. We chartered a bus to the Philmont Scout Ranch in Northern New Mexico and began our 60 mile backpack trek. Afterwards, we boarded Amtrak's and rode the rails to Kingman, and then chartered a bus home.

    <h3>My Trip To The Mid West</h3>
    <p>
        My wife and I drove our son's little red Ford Mustang some 2,900 miles to him in Indiana where he attends college. In route, we stopped at Nauvoo, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan. We then boarded Amtrak in Chicago, and rode it to Salt Lake City, where we boarded a bus which returned us to Las Vegas.
