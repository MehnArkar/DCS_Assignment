    <h1>Basic HTML Display Features</h1>

    <p class="thin-text">
        A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming. Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too are words. I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the use of new technologies, but not the other way around. A Web page tells a great story with great graphical and analytical presentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the "View" option look at the source code for this document. The background color and the text declared in the body refer to a coding system that combines a system of numbers and letters to create thousands of possible color choices. The body color indicates white and the text as being black. I could have just written in "white" and "black" instead of these codes.
    </p>

    <p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>

    <p>To begin, we can change the</p>
    <p class="header-size">header size</p>

    <p>and <span class="color-text">color</span> <span class="red-text">of</span> <span class="letters">letters</span> seen on the screen. The <span class="font-size">font size</span> can be changed as well, and actually gives more choices.</p>

    <p>
        We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing word types in a blocked quote. Now is the <span class="italic-text">time</span> for all good <span class="bold-text">people to come</span> to the <span class="italic-text">aid</span> of their country.
    </p>

    <p class="nested-command">That was also an example of a nested command.</p>
